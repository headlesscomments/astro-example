# AStro Example

Features:

- âœ… All features from Astro's default starter
- âœ… List comments on blog posts
- âœ… Add comments to blog posts

This example uses Vue to list and add comments to blog posts, however, statically rendering comments is also possible with Astro.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started with this site, you'll need to add your Headless Comments API key and Site ID to /src/comments/index.ts, or as environment variables.

```ts
const api = new HeadlessComments("YOUR_API_KEY_HERE", "YOUR_SITE_ID_HERE");
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
|   â”œâ”€â”€ comments/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.
